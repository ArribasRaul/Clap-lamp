Checking integrity of Schematic and Pcb designs in project "Proyecto"
=====================================================================

The PCB and Schematic designs do not match.
To bring them into line, you will need to make the following changes to the PCB design:


Disconnect PL3.1 from Net "+AC"
Disconnect PL3.3 from Net "-AC"

Delete Component "PL3" [CONN_SIL_3]

Component 'L4940V5' package 'TO270P460X1020X2008-3P' in Schematic is newer version than PCB, use Update Component to correct this.

Value "RS Price/Stock" on component instance "IC2" caused by library item mismatch.

Use Update to reload Component "L4940V5" to add/alter Value "Mouser Part Number"
Use Update to reload Component "L4940V5" to add/alter Value "Mouser Price/Stock"
Use Update to reload Component "L4940V5" to add/alter Value "Arrow Part Number"

Use Update to reload Component "L4940V5" to add/alter Value "Datasheet Link"
Use Update to reload Component "L4940V5" to add/alter Value "RS Part Number"
Use Update to reload Component "L4940V5" to add/alter Value "Allied_Number"
Connect Pin PL4-+ to Net "+AC"
