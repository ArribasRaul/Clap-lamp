# Sound-Activated Lamp Project
This project involves modifying a lamp to activate in response to clapping or finger snapping. The printed circuit board (PCB) incorporates an LED as the primary light source and has the capability to control an additional lamp using a relay.

## Project Contents
- **Project:** `Proyecto.prj`
- **Schematic:** `Esquematico.sch` file showcasing the electrical design of the project.
- **PCB Design:** `PCB.pcb` file representing the printed circuit board layout.
- **Gerber Files:** Folder containing necessary files for PCB fabrication.
- **Libraries:** Folder including component libraries used in the design.

## Tools Used
The PCB design was created using DesignSpark PCB, an electronic circuit design tool.

## Usage Instructions
1. **PCB Fabrication:**
   - Use the provided Gerber files to fabricate the PCB through a PCB manufacturing service.
   
2. **Assembly:**
   - Follow the schematic to assemble the components onto the PCB.
   
3. **Testing:**
   - Once assembled, test the lamp to ensure it activates correctly in response to clapping or finger snapping.
